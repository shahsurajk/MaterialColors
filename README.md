# MaterialColors
All colours of the material palette in XML for quick development. 

## How to use it?
Android uses colors in XML format, this project contains a colors.xml file with all the colors in material palette, found [here](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-palette)

Check for the suitable color palette and copy the list of colors to your `colors.xml` file. 

For e.g. for the Teal color palette, look for teal in the `colors.xml` file and copy the enitre block of code to your colors.xml file and you're done. Then you can access the color using `@color/teal_xxx` where xxx is the shade of the color required. 

## How to add more colors?
Create a pull request or edit it on the go, i'll review the color palette once and it's done. Happy contributing.
